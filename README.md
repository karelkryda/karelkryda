<!-- About me section -->
<h2>🙋🏻‍♂️ Something about me</h2>
<h3>👨🏻‍💻 My lore</h3>
I have been close to computers and information technology in general since I was a kid. In primary school I started as a computer repairman and webmaster, and in high school I discovered the magic of software development and devoted myself fully to it.

\
I learned a lot of programming languages, how to create mobile apps, desktop apps and a lot more. During my high school years, I created a huge number of projects that kept me improving my skills and acquiring new ones. During this period, I became interested in creating a homelab (read as a small home datacenter 😅). I bought a few servers and started to fully commit to it.
The combination of development and systems administration knowledge gave me the ability to create almost anything and it was amazing.

After high school, I decided to go to college, but after a few months I realized I didn't want to go in that direction and found a job as a DevOps engineer.
Over the last couple of years in this position, I have been exposed to a lot of new technologies and techniques as well as working with cloud providers.

<h3>🕯️ Interests</h3>
In general, I'm interested in everything related to IT.

I care a lot about safety and security in the IT world and try to be involved in this direction.

I like to work on my own projects and listen to good - and sometimes even bad 😇 - music.
\
Sometimes I even play a computer game, either alone or with friends.

<h3>🎯 Goals</h3>
As a teenager, I made a commitment to myself to be able to do everything in IT. Whether it's computer networking, software development, operating system administration, or anything else - so I guess that's my goal for the future.

\
But among other things, I'd like to learn how to develop and work with AI systems in the future - after all, it's not easy to re-create Jarvis from Iron Man 🤖😁.

<!-- Music section -->
<h2>🎸 What I'm listening to</h2>
I spend most of my day listening to music. It helps me relax and focus on my work.

Given this amount of time, I'm always trying to discover new genres and artists.

Here's a taste of what I've been listening to recently or am listening to right now 😉:
